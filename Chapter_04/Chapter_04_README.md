Chapter 4 in the *SK2 User's Guide* introduces users to Python, how to install it onto the SK2 and provides a number of "Getting Started with Python" examples.

The Python firmware image contains a simple, easy-to-use IDE for creating and running Python examples. The installation directions, Python IDE, and the following examples are described in Chapter 4 of the SK2 Users Guide.

Order | Example                   | Description
------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
0     | py_install_cmds.txt       | Commands for installing the Python firmware image.

8     |  wwan_class.py            | A Python class for accessing and using the WWAN LED on the SK2.
9     | wwan_blink.py             | Importing and using the WWAN Class to blink the WWAN LED.
10    | wwan_on.py                | Turning on the WWAN LED.
11    | wwan_off.py               | Turning off the WWAN LED.
12    | wwan_read.py              | Reading the current value of the WWAN LED.
13    | button_interrupt.py       | Using the GPIO button as an interrupt source.
14    | button_interrupt_fancy.py | A fancier GPIO button interrupt example.

To use these commands, you will need to install the Python firmware image to the SK2. (You will need to download the firmware from the AT&T SK2 product page. See the User's Guide PDF file for installation directions.)

*Warning:* At the time of this writing, the original SK2 image has not been posted to the AT&T Website, therefore, you might not be able to restore the device's original image.
